# Exercise 2: writing and executing functions (II)

# Write a function `CompareLength` that takes in 2 vectors, and returns the sentence:
# "The difference in lengths is N"
CompareLength <- function(a, b) {
  diff <- abs(length(a) - length(b))
  return (paste("The difference in lengths is ", diff))
}

# Pass two vectors of different length to your `CompareLength` function
CompareLength(c(1,2), c(3,4,5,6,7,8))

# Write a function `DescribeDifference` that will return one of the following statements:
# "Your first vector is longer by N elements"
# "Your second vector is longer by N elements"
DescribeDifference <- function(a, b) {
  diff <- length(a) - length(b)
  if (diff > 0) {
    return (paste("The first vector is longer by ", diff, " elements."))
  } else {
    return (paste("The second vector is longer by", -diff, "elements."))
  }
}

# Pass two vectors to your `DescribeDifference` function
DescribeDifference(c(1,3,4,5), c(3,4,5))


### Bonus ###

# Rewrite your `DescribeDifference` function to tell you the name of the vector which is longer
